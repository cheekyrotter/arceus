# Arceus (Libary/Utility Mod)

## About 
This is a library/utility mod that adds:
- Batch loading files and loading all files (with error handling)
- Optional error handling for joker functions
- Version checking for mods (i.e. checking for updates)

This is primarily for developers and playtesting to reduce disruption during testing.
